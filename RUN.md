# Getting Started

## Installation

`git clone https://github.com/kcoopermiller/rust-openai.git`

To use this library, you'll need a GPT-3 API Key. Once obtained, add it to a `.env` file by doing the following:

1. Create a `.env` file in the root of your package
2. In `.env`, add your api key:
   `API_KEY=[your api key]`

Now use the command `cargo run --example examples` to generate a completions endpoint
